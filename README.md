# 🧩 Model Extractor – Inspect, Analyze & Export ML Models

This repository contains an easy-to-use **Model Extractor** tool designed to load machine learning models and extract useful components such as:

- Model architecture  
- Trainable & non-trainable parameters  
- Layer structure  
- Weight tensors  
- Metadata and config  
- Export-ready summaries  

It is ideal for debugging, model conversion, documentation, and research workflows.
